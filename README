# Dumbaldor

macOS Tor IP Changer — automatically rotates your Tor exit IP at a set interval.

## Install
```bash
brew tap ...
brew install dumbaldor
```

Or manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/dumbaldor.git
cd dumbaldor
chmod +x dumbaldor.sh
./dumbaldor.sh
```

## Requirements

- macOS
- [Tor](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tor) (`brew install tor`)
- Tor must be running (`tor &` or `brew services start tor`)

## Usage
```bash
dumbaldor
```

The script sends a HUP signal to Tor every 5 seconds to get a new exit IP, then displays the current IP via the Tor SOCKS proxy.

## How it works

1. Sends `SIGHUP` to the Tor process to request a new circuit
2. Queries `check.torproject.org` through the SOCKS5 proxy on `127.0.0.1:9050`
3. Displays the new exit IP
